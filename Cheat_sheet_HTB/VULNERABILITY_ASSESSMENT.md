*in this assessment we work to  patch, mitigate, or remove the vulnerability.*

- *`Black box` pentesting is done with no knowledge of a network's configuration or applications.*
- *`Grey box` pentesting is done with a little bit of knowledge of the network they're testing, from a perspective equivalent to an employee who doesn't work in the IT department*
- *`White box` pentesting is typically conducted by giving the penetration tester full access to all systems, configurations, build documents, etc., and source code if web applications are in-scope.*

- *`Application pentesters` assess web applications, thick-client applications, APIs, and mobile applications.*
- *`Network` or `infrastructure` pentesters assess all aspects of a computer network, including its networking devices*

**Types of pentests** 
1. evasive 
2. non-evasive
3. hybrid evasive

- *`Physical pentesters` try to leverage physical security weaknesses and breakdowns in processes to gain access to a facility*
- *`Social engineering` pentesters test human beings.*

*Vulnerability assessments look for vulnerabilities in networks without simulating cyber attacks.  pentest is a simulated cyber attack to see if and how the network can be penetrated. *

*The purpose of a Vulnerability Assessment is to understand, identify, and categorize the risk for the more apparent issues present in an environment without actually exploiting them to gain further access.*

# key terms 

### **vulnerability**  
*it is a weekness or bug in the orgination's including application networks, and infrastructure etc. MITRE's Common Vulnerability Exposure database and receive a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score to determine severity*
- `score (Risk) = threat + vulberability`

### *Threat*
*A Threat is a process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event*

### **Exploit**
*Exploit is a code or payload that can be used to attack an weekness*

* [Exploit DB](https://exploit-db.com/)
* [Rapid7 vulnerability and exploit database](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### **Risk**
*Risk is the possibility of assets or data being harmed*

*for understanding*

    Risk: something bad that could happen
    Threat: something bad that is happening
    Vulnerabilities: weaknesses that could lead to a threat

# Asset Management
### **Asset inventory**
Asset inventory is a critical component of vulnerability management. An organization needs to understand what assets are in its network to provide the proper protection and set up appropriate defenses.

# Assessment Standards
### **Compliance Standards**

Each regulatory compliance body has its own information security standards that organizations must adhere to maintain their accreditation. Big player for making standards `PCI` `HIPAA` `FISMA` and `ISO 27001`

`Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)` is a known standard in information security that handle credit cards.

`HIPAA` is the `Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act`, which is used to protect patients' data.

`Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)` is a set of standards and guidelines used to safeguard government operations and information.

`International Organization for Standardization (ISO)` maintains technical standards for pretty much anything you can imagine. `ISO 27001` is a standard used worldwide to manage information security. requires organizations to perform quarterly external and internal scans.

### Penetration Testing Standards
- It should not be performed without any `rules` or `guidelines`.
- Must defined `scope`
- owner must have `signed legal contract` with pentesters.
- keep minimal harm is done to a company's computers and networks by pentesters.
- Penetration testers should avoid making changes

## **Guidelines for the penetration testers.**

### PTES  ( Penetration Testing Execution Standard )
- Pre-engagement Interactions
- Intelligence Gathering
- Threat Modeling
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Exploitation
- Post Exploitation
- Reporting

### OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)
It is divided into five different channels for five different areas of pentesting:

- Human Security (human beings are subject to social engineering exploits)
- Physical Security
- Wireless Communications (including but not limited to technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth)
- Telecommunications
- Data Networks

### NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) 
- Planning
- Discovery
- Attack
- Reporting

### OWASP ( Open Web Application Security Project )
- [Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
- [Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/)
- [Firmware Security Testing Methodology](https://github.com/scriptingxss/owasp-fstm)

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
There are various ways to score or calculate severity ratings of vulnerabilities. `DREAD` is a risk assessment system developed by Microsoft to help IT security professionals evaluate the severity of security threats and vulnerabilities. The CVSS system helps categorize the risk associated with an issue and allows organizations to prioritize issues based on the rating.

### CIA  Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

*Confidentiality -* it is all about access controls data(keep data provate)

*Integrity -* is the data complete or authentic (provides data is not tempered, while soring and while retriving.)
 
*Availability -*  always up and always accessible
