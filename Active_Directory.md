**Why Active Directory?**

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service for Windows network environments. It is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization's resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices, file shares, group policies, devices, and trusts. AD provides authentication and authorization functions within a Windows domain environment.

Active Directory makes information easy to find and use for administrators and users. AD is highly scalable, supports millions of objects per domain, and allows the creation of additional domains as an organization grows.

# Active Directory Structure

objects in AD
objects| objects
|-|-|
Domain Computers|	Domain Users
Domain Group Information	|Organizational Units (OUs)
Default Domain Policy|	Functional Domain Levels
Password Policy	|Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
Domain Trusts	|Access Control Lists (ACLs)

a very (simplistic) high level, an AD structure may look as follows:

    INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/
    ├── ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
    │   ├── GPOs
    │   └── OU
    │       └── EMPLOYEES
    │           ├── COMPUTERS
    │           │   └── FILE01
    │           ├── GROUPS
    │           │   └── HQ Staff
    │           └── USERS
    │               └── barbara.jones
    ├── CORP.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
    └── DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

# Active Directory Terminology

**Object -** An object can be defined as ANY resource present within an Active Directory environment such as OUs, printers, users, domain controllers, etc.

**Attributes -** Every object in Active Directory has an associated set of attributes used to define characteristics of the given object. A computer object contains attributes such as the hostname and DNS name. All attributes in AD have an associated LDAP name that can be used when performing LDAP queries, such as displayName for Full Name and given name for First Name.

**Schema -** The Active Directory schema is essentially the blueprint of any enterprise environment. It defines what types of objects can exist in the AD database and their associated attributes. It lists definitions corresponding to AD objects and holds information about each object.


**Domain -** A domain is a logical group of objects such as computers, users, OUs, groups, etc. We can think of each domain as a different city within a state or country. Domains can operate entirely independently of one another or be connected via trust relationships.

**Forest -** A forest is a collection of Active Directory domains. It is the topmost container and contains all of the AD objects introduced below, including but not limited to domains, users, groups, computers, and Group Policy objects. A forest can contain one or multiple domains

**Tree -** A tree is a collection of Active Directory domains that begins at a single root domain. A forest is a collection of AD trees. Each domain in a tree shares a boundary with the other domains. A parent-child trust relationship is formed when a domain is added under another domain in a tree. Two trees in the same forest cannot share a name (namespace). 

**Container** Container objects hold other objects and have a defined place in the directory subtree hierarchy.

**Leaf** Leaf objects do not contain other objects and are found at the end of the subtree hierarchy.

**Global Unique Identifier (GUID)** This GUID value is unique across the enterprise, similar to a MAC address. Every single object created by Active Directory is assigned a GUID, not only user and group objects. The GUID is stored in the ObjectGUID attribute. Specifying the ObjectGUID value when performing AD enumeration will ensure that we get the most accurate results pertaining to the object we are searching for information about. The ObjectGUID property never changes and is associated with the object for as long as that object exists in the domain.

**Security principals** Security principals are anything that the operating system can authenticate, including users, computer accounts, or even threads/processes that run in the context of a user or computer account 

**Security Identifier (SID)** A security identifier, or SID is used as a unique identifier for a security principal or security group. Every account, group, or process has its own unique SID, which, in an AD environment, is issued by the domain controller and stored in a secure database.


**Distinguished Name (DN)** A Distinguished Name (DN) describes the full path to an object in AD 

**Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)** A Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) is a single component of the Distinguished Name that identifies the object as unique from other objects at the current level in the naming hierarchy.

**sAMAccountName** The sAMAccountName is the user's logon name. Here it would just be bjones. It must be a unique value and 20 or fewer characters.

**userPrincipalName** The userPrincipalName attribute is another way to identify users in AD. This attribute consists of a prefix (the user account name) and a suffix (the domain name) in the format of bjones@inlanefreight.local. This attribute is not mandatory.
