# HTTP/HTTPS

![FQDN](image.png)


![HTTP_FLOW](image-1.png)

- Our browsers usually first look up records in the local '/etc/hosts' file, and if the requested domain does not exist within it, then they would contact other DNS servers.

Field	Example	Description
Method	GET	The HTTP method or verb, which specifies the type of action to perform.
Path	/users/login.html	The path to the resource being accessed. This field can also be suffixed with a query string (e.g. ?username=user).
Version	HTTP/1.1	The third and final field is used to denote the HTTP version.

General Headers

Header	Example	Description
Date	Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2022 10:38:44 GMT	Holds the date and time at which the message originated. It's preferred to convert the time to the standard UTC time zone.
Connection	Connection: close	Dictates if the current network connection should stay alive after the request finishes. Two commonly used values for this header are close and keep-alive. The close value from either the client or server means that they would like to terminate the connection, while the keep-alive header indicates that the connection should remain open to receive more data and input.


Entity| Headers
|-|-|
Header|	Example	Description
Content-Type|	Content-Type: text/html	Used to describe the type of resource being transferred. The value is automatically added by the browsers on the client-side and returned in the server response. The charset field denotes the encoding standard, such as UTF-8.
Media-Type|	Media-Type: application/pdf	The media-type is similar to Content-Type, and describes the data being transferred. This header can play a crucial role in making the server interpret our input. The charset field may also be used with this header.
Boundary|	boundary="b4e4fbd93540"	Acts as a marker to separate content when there is more than one in the same message. For example, within a form data, this boundary gets used as --b4e4fbd93540 to separate different parts of the form.
Content-Length|	Content-Length: 385	Holds the size of the entity being passed. This header is necessary as the server uses it to read data from the message body, and is automatically generated by the browser and tools like cURL.
Content-Encoding|	Content-Encoding: gzip	Data can undergo multiple transformations before being passed. For example, large amounts of data can be compressed to reduce the message size. The type of encoding being used should be specified using the Content-Encoding header.


Request Headers

Header	Example	Description
Host	Host: www.inlanefreight.com	Used to specify the host being queried for the resource. This can be a domain name or an IP address. HTTP servers can be configured to host different websites, which are revealed based on the hostname. This makes the host header an important enumeration target, as it can indicate the existence of other hosts on the target server.
User-Agent	User-Agent: curl/7.77.0	The User-Agent header is used to describe the client requesting resources. This header can reveal a lot about the client, such as the browser, its version, and the operating system.
Referer	Referer: http://www.inlanefreight.com/	Denotes where the current request is coming from. For example, clicking a link from Google search results would make https://google.com the referer. Trusting this header can be dangerous as it can be easily manipulated, leading to unintended consequences.
Accept	Accept: */*	The Accept header describes which media types the client can understand. It can contain multiple media types separated by commas. The */* value signifies that all media types are accepted.
Cookie	Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540	Contains cookie-value pairs in the format name=value. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the client-side and on the server, which acts as an identifier. These are passed to the server per request, thus maintaining the client's access. Cookies can also serve other purposes, such as saving user preferences or session tracking. There can be multiple cookies in a single header separated by a semi-colon.
Authorization	Authorization: BASIC cGFzc3dvcmQK	Another method for the server to identify clients. After successful authentication, the server returns a token unique to the client. Unlike cookies, tokens are stored only on the client-side and retrieved by the server per request. There are multiple types of authentication types based on the webserver and application type used.


Response Headers

Header	Example	Description
Server	Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)	Contains information about the HTTP server, which processed the request. It can be used to gain information about the server, such as its version, and enumerate it further.
Set-Cookie	Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540	Contains the cookies needed for client identification. Browsers parse the cookies and store them for future requests. This header follows the same format as the Cookie request header.
WWW-Authenticate	WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="localhost"	Notifies the client about the type of authentication required to access the requested resource.


Security Headers

Header	Example	Description
Content-Security-Policy	Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'	Dictates the website's policy towards externally injected resources. This could be JavaScript code as well as script resources. This header instructs the browser to accept resources only from certain trusted domains, hence preventing attacks such as Cross-site scripting (XSS).
Strict-Transport-Security	Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000	Prevents the browser from accessing the website over the plaintext HTTP protocol, and forces all communication to be carried over the secure HTTPS protocol. This prevents attackers from sniffing web traffic and accessing protected information such as passwords or other sensitive data.
Referrer-Policy	Referrer-Policy: origin	Dictates whether the browser should include the value specified via the Referer header or not. It can help in avoiding disclosing sensitive URLs and information while browsing the website.

# Methods

Method	Description
GET	Requests a specific resource. Additional data can be passed to the server via query strings in the URL (e.g. ?param=value).
POST	Sends data to the server. It can handle multiple types of input, such as text, PDFs, and other forms of binary data. This data is appended in the request body present after the headers. The POST method is commonly used when sending information (e.g. forms/logins) or uploading data to a website, such as images or documents.
HEAD	Requests the headers that would be returned if a GET request was made to the server. It doesn't return the request body and is usually made to check the response length before downloading resources.
PUT	Creates new resources on the server. Allowing this method without proper controls can lead to uploading malicious resources.
DELETE	Deletes an existing resource on the webserver. If not properly secured, can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) by deleting critical files on the web server.
OPTIONS	Returns information about the server, such as the methods accepted by it.
PATCH	Applies partial modifications to the resource at the specified location.

Responce Code

Type	Description
1xx	Provides information and does not affect the processing of the request.
2xx	Returned when a request succeeds.
3xx	Returned when the server redirects the client.
4xx	Signifies improper requests from the client. For example, requesting a resource that doesn't exist or requesting a bad format.
5xx	Returned when there is some problem with the HTTP server itself.
