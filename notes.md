 <h1 style="text-align:center">LINUX</h1>


# Philosophy
Linux follows five core principles:

Principle|	Description
|-|-|
Everything is a file|	All configuration files for the various services running on the Linux operating system are stored in one or more text files.
Small, single-purpose programs|	Linux offers many different tools that we will work with, which can be combined to work together.
Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks|	The integration and combination of different tools enable us to carry out many large and complex tasks, such as processing or filtering specific data results.
Avoid captive user interfaces|	Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell (or terminal), which gives the user greater control over the operating system.
Configuration data stored in a text file|	An example of such a file is the /etc/passwd file, which stores all users registered on the system.
****
# Components
Component|	Description
|-|-|
Bootloader|	A piece of code that runs to guide the booting process to start the operating system. Parrot Linux uses the GRUB Bootloader.
OS Kernel|	The kernel is the main component of an operating system. It manages the resources for system's I/O devices at the hardware level.
Daemons|	Background services are called "daemons" in Linux. Their purpose is to ensure that key functions such as scheduling, printing, and multimedia are working correctly. These small programs load after we booted or log into the computer.
OS Shell|	The operating system shell or the command language interpreter (also known as the command line) is the interface between the OS and the user. This interface allows the user to tell the OS what to do. The most commonly used shells are Bash, Tcsh/Csh, Ksh, Zsh, and Fish.
Graphics server|	This provides a graphical sub-system (server) called "X" or "X-server" that allows graphical programs to run locally or remotely on the X-windowing system.
Window Manager|	Also known as a graphical user interface (GUI). There are many options, including GNOME, KDE, MATE, Unity, and Cinnamon. A desktop environment usually has several applications, including file and web browsers. These allow the user to access and manage the essential and frequently accessed features and services of an operating system.
Utilities|	Applications or utilities are programs that perform particular functions for the user or another program.

# Linux Architecture
The Linux operating system can be broken down into layers:

Layer|	Description
|-|-|
Hardware	|Peripheral devices such as the system's RAM, hard drive, CPU, and others.
Kernel|	The core of the Linux operating system whose function is to virtualize and control common computer hardware resources like CPU, allocated memory, accessed data, and others. The kernel gives each process its own virtual resources and prevents/mitigates conflicts between different processes.
Shell|	A command-line interface (CLI), also known as a shell that a user can enter commands into to execute the kernel's functions.
System Utility	|Makes available to the user all of the operating system's functionality.|

![File_system](image.png)

Path|	Description
|-|-|
/|	The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root.
/bin|	Contains essential command binaries.
/boot|	Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.
/dev|	Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.
/etc|	Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as well.
/home|	Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for storage.
/lib|	Shared library files that are required for system boot.
/media|	External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.
/mnt|	Temporary mount point for regular filesystems.
/opt|	Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here.
/root|	The home directory for the root user.
/sbin|	This directory contains executables used for system administration (binary system files).
/tmp|	The operating system and many programs use this directory to store temporary files. This directory is generally cleared upon system boot and may be deleted at other times without any warning.
/usr|	Contains executables, libraries, man files, etc.
/var|	This directory contains variable data files such as log files, email in-boxes, web application related files, cron files, and more.

## working with directory

    touch <name>                  #create file
    mkdir <name>                  #create directory
    mkdir -p Storage/local/user/documents         #dir in the dir
    tree .                                        #structure of the directory
    mv <file/directory> <renamed file/directory>  #move the file or dir
    cp Storage/readme.txt Storage/local/          #copy the file from one to another
    nano <filename>                               #edit a file/ create a file and edit on the go
    cat <filename>                                #print the content of file to the terminal

## Find Files and Directories

    which <programname>                          #path to the program
    locate *.conf                                #locate filename
    find <location> <options>                    #file the specific file or the dir


    find / -type f -name *.conf -user root -size +20k -newermt 2020-03-03 -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null

Option|	Description
|-|-|
-type f|	Hereby, we define the type of the searched object. In this case, 'f' stands for 'file'.
-name *.conf|	With '-name', we indicate the name of the file we are looking for. The asterisk (*) stands for 'all' files with the '.conf' extension.
-user root|	This option filters all files whose owner is the root user.
-size +20k|	We can then filter all the located files and specify that we only want to see the files that are larger than 20 KiB.
-newermt 2020-03-03|	With this option, we set the date. Only files newer than the specified date will be presented.
-exec ls -al {} \;|	This option executes the specified command, using the curly brackets as placeholders for each result. The backslash escapes the next character from being interpreted by the shell because otherwise, the semicolon would terminate the command and not reach the redirection.
2>/dev/null|	This is a STDERR redirection to the 'null device', which we will come back to in the next section. This redirection ensures that no errors are displayed in the terminal. This redirection must not be an option of the 'find' command.

**SUID & SGID** - Besides assigning direct user and group permissions, we can also configure special permissions for files by setting the Set User ID (SUID) and Set Group ID (SGID) bits. These SUID/SGID bits allow,

**Sticky Bit -** Sticky bits are a type of file permission in Linux that can be set on directories. This type of permission provides an extra layer of security when controlling the deletion and renaming of files within a directory. It is typically used on directories that are shared by multiple users to prevent one user from accidentally deleting or renaming files that are important to others. If the sticky bit is capitalized (T), then this means that all other users do not have execute (x) permissions and, therefore, cannot see the contents of the folder nor run any programs from it. The lowercase sticky bit (t) is the sticky bit where the execute (x) permissions have been set.


# System Management

## User Management
Command|	Description
|-|-|
sudo|	Execute command as a different user.
su|	The su utility requests appropriate user credentials via PAM and switches to that user ID (the default user is the superuser). A shell |is then executed.
useradd|	Creates a new user or update default new user information.
userdel|	Deletes a user account and related files.
usermod|	Modifies a user account.
addgroup|	Adds a group to the system.
delgroup|	Removes a group from the system.
passwd|	Changes user password.

## package manager

Command|	Description
|-|-|
dpkg|	The dpkg is a tool to install, build, remove, and manage Debian packages. The primary and more user-friendly front-end for dpkg is aptitude.
apt|	Apt provides a high-level command-line interface for the package management system.
aptitude|	Aptitude is an alternative to apt and is a high-level interface to the package manager.
snap|	Install, configure, refresh, and remove snap packages. Snaps enable the secure distribution of the latest apps and utilities for the cloud, servers, desktops, and the internet of things.
gem|	Gem is the front-end to RubyGems, the standard package manager for Ruby.
pip|	Pip is a Python package installer recommended for installing Python packages that are not available in the Debian archive. It can work with version control repositories (currently only Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories), logs output extensively, and prevents partial installs by downloading all requirements before starting installation.
git|	Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

## Service and Process Management

    systemctl start ssh
    systemctl status ssh
    systemctl enable ssh

    ps -aux | grep ssh
    systemctl list-units --type=service
