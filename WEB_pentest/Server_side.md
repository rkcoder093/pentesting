# File Transversal

this vulnerebility enables the attacker to read the file from the system. 

example:

    <img src="/loadImage?filename=218.png"> // this fetch the image from the server

internally it is reading the file fron here `/var/www/images/218.png`. This application implements no defenses against path traversal attacks. and it leads to read any file form the system  with the user privilage. `/etc/passwd`

    https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd 

`../../../` if the valid path to move up in the directory structure. and afte 3 step up it is in top dir.

linux - `../`
windows - `../` , `..\` both ar eapplied.

# Access Control.
![ACCESS CONTROL](image.png)
who or what is authorized to perform actions or access resources. authentication managment.

**Authentication** confirms that the user is who they say they are.

**Session management** identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user.

**Access control** determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.

**1. Vertucal Privilage Escalation** - example - non-addmin use get hte acees of admin page.

unprotected control - `robots.txt` , js that revil the sensitive information.

Parameter-based access control methods -  the user's access rights or role at login, and then store this information in a user-controllable location. like  - hidden field, cookies and preset query string parameter.

**2. Horizontal privilege escalation** - gain access to the another user account with the same level of access contorl and funcanalaty.
    
    https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=123

If an attacker modifies the id parameter value to that of another user, they might gain access to another user's account page, and the associated data and functions. this is an example of `indirec object referance (IDOR)`


# Authentication vulnerabilities

![Auth](image-1.png)

**Authenticatiin vs Authorization**
Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.

**1. Brute-force attacks** - A brute-force attack is when an attacker uses a system of trial and error to guess valid user credentials

# SSRF 

![SSRF](image-2.png)

In a typical SSRF attack, the attacker might cause the server to make a connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure. In other cases, they may be able to force the server to connect to arbitrary external systems. This could leak sensitive data, such as authorization credentials.

**SSRF attacks against the server** -   In an SSRF attack against the server, the attacker causes the application to make an HTTP request back to the server that is hosting the application, via its loopback network interface. like `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.


# File Upload Vulnerubality:

**What are file upload vulnerabilities?**

File upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size. Failing to properly enforce restrictions on these could mean that even a basic image upload function can be used to upload arbitrary and potentially dangerous files instead. This could even include server-side script files that enable remote code execution.

to check the files

    <?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file'); ?>

for comands 

    <?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>

using this use the exploit code

    GET /example/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1

- changing thte content-type to valid one.

# OS command injection

allows an attacker to execute operating system (OS) commands on the server that is running an application, and typically fully compromise the application and its data


Purpose of command|	Linux|	Windows|
|-|-|-|
Name of current user|	whoami|	whoami|
Operating system|	uname -a|	ver|
Network configuration|	ifconfig|	ipconfig /all|
Network connections|	netstat -an	|netstat -an|
Running processes|	ps -ef|	tasklist|


# SQL injection (SQLi)

SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database

try these to detact SQLi:

- The single quote character ' and look for errors or other anomalies.
S- ome SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
- Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2, and look for differences in the application's responses.
- Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond.
- OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions.
