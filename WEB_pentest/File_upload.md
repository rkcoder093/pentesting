# FILE UNPLOAD VULN

**1. Absent validation**
no validation implemented, but before uploading any webshell script check what are the programming language running on the server, then upload the webshell in that programming language.
**To check the programing language**
- try navigating to the index page and see in which extension it give us the same page.
- extension - `Wappalyzer`
- `burp fuzzzing` and `Fuff tool`

test the vulnerability by uploading the arbatiry files.
then upload the webshell to exploit it.


# Client-Side Validation

1. the file format validation is happening on the client-side, we can easily bypass it by directly interacting with the server, skipping the front-end validations altogether. We may also modify the front-end code through our browser's dev tools to disable any validation in place.
2. we can use burp also capture the request and modify it to bypass the client side validation
3. or disable the validation from the html code of the page because client side is using only javascript to validate.

# Blacklisted list

The code is taking the file extension ($extension) from the uploaded file name ($fileName) and then comparing it against a list of blacklisted extensions ($blacklist). However, this validation method has a major flaw. It is not comprehensive, as many other extensions are not included in this list, which may still be used to execute PHP code on the back-end server if uploaded.

The comparison above is also case-sensitive, and is only considering lowercase extensions. In Windows Servers, file names are case insensitive, so we may try uploading a php with a mixed-case (e.g. pHp), which may bypass the blacklist as well, and should still execute as a PHP script.
