# XSS

XSS vulnerabilities take advantage of a flaw in user input sanitization to "write" JavaScript code to the page and execute it on the client side, leading to several types of attacks.

type 
Type|	Description
|-|-|
Stored (Persistent) XSS|	The most critical type of XSS, which occurs when user input is stored on the back-end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments)
Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS	|Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored (e.g., search result or error message)
DOM-based XSS|	Another Non-Persistent XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server (e.g., through client-side HTTP parameters or anchor tags)

## Stored XSS
The first and most critical type of XSS vulnerability is Stored XSS or Persistent XSS. If our injected XSS payload gets stored in the back-end database and retrieved upon visiting the page, this means that our XSS attack is persistent and may affect any user that visits the page.

payload to check 

    <script>alert(window.origin)</script>
    <script>print()</script>

## Reflected XSS
There are two types of Non-Persistent XSS vulnerabilities: Reflected XSS, which gets processed by the back-end server, and DOM-based XSS, which is completely processed on the client-side and never reaches the back-end server.

# DOM XSS
The third and final type of XSS is another Non-Persistent type called DOM-based XSS. While reflected XSS sends the input data to the back-end server through HTTP requests, DOM XSS is completely processed on the client-side through JavaScript. DOM XSS occurs when JavaScript is used to change the page source through the Document Object Model (DOM).

The `Source` is the JavaScript object that takes the user input, and it can be any input parameter like a URL parameter or an input field, as we saw above.

the `Sink` is the function that writes the user input to a DOM Object on the page. 

    <img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>

**XSS discovery tools are `XSS Strike` `Brute XSS` and `XSSer`.**

**Note**
1. XSS can be injected into any input in the HTML page, which is not exclusive to HTML input fields, but may also be in HTTP headers like the Cookie or User-Agent (i.e., when their values are displayed on the page). To understand which payload should work,
2. try to view how your input is displayed in the HTML source after you add it.

## Defacing
Defacing a website means changing its look for anyone who visits the website. It is very common for hacker groups to deface a website to claim that they had successfully hacked it\
