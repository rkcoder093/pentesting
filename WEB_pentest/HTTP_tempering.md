HTTP verb

|Verb|	Description|
|-|-|
|HEAD|	Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains the headers, without the response body|
|PUT|	Writes the request payload to the specified location|
|DELETE|	Deletes the resource at the specified location|
|OPTIONS|	Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs|
|PATCH|	Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location|

two types 
1. insecure server configuration - many automated vulnerability scanning tools can consistently identify HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities caused by insecure server configurations
2. insecure coding - usually miss identifying HTTP Tampering vulnerabilities caused by insecure coding.

**Identify insecure server config**
bypass this with an HTTP Verb Tampering attack. To do so, 

- we need to identify which pages are restricted by this authentication.
- we need to check the how the web application is handling the other verbs requests.
- we need to check the what are the http verb is accepting by the web application.

    curl -i -X OPTIONS http://SERVER_IP:PORT/

exploit with one of the allowed verb.

**Identify insecure Coding**
No matter what we try, the web application properly blocks our requests and is secured against injection attempts. However, we may try an HTTP Verb Tampering attack to see if we can bypass the security filter altogether.

Exploit - by changing the request inject the command injection


## Verb Tampering Prevention
**Insecure Configuration** - The vulnerability usually happens when we limit a page's authorization to a particular set of HTTP verbs/methods, which leaves the other remaining methods unprotected.

it is not secure to limit the authorization configuration to a specific HTTP verb. This is why we should always avoid restricting authorization to a particular HTTP method and always allow/deny all HTTP verbs and methods

If we want to specify a single method, we can use safe keywords, like LimitExcept in Apache, http-method-omission in Tomcat, and add/remove in ASP.NET, which cover all verbs except the specified ones.

to avoid similar attacks, we should generally consider disabling/denying all HEAD requests unless specifically required by the web application.

**Insecure Coding** - 

To avoid HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities in our code, we must be consistent with our use of HTTP methods and ensure that the same method is always used for any specific functionality across the web application. It is always advised to expand the scope of testing in security filters by testing all request parameters.
