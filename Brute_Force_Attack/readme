# BruteForce

A Brute Force attack is a method of attempting to guess passwords or keys by automated probing.

The HTTP specification provides two parallel authentication mechanisms:

1. Basic HTTP AUTH is used to authenticate the user to the HTTP server.

2. Proxy Server Authentication is used to authenticate the user to an intermediate proxy server.


Attack	Description
Online Brute Force Attack	Attacking a live application over the network, like HTTP, HTTPs, SSH, FTP, and others
Offline Brute Force Attack	Also known as Offline Password Cracking, where you attempt to crack a hash of an encrypted password.
Reverse Brute Force Attack	Also known as username brute-forcing, where you try a single common password with a list of usernames on a certain service.
Hybrid Brute Force Attack	Attacking a user by creating a customized password wordlist, built using known intelligence about the user or the service.
